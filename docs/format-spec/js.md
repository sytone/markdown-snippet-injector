title: Snippet Injector - Defining snippets in `JavaScript` and `TypeScript` source files
---

Defining code snippets in your source files is done by enclosing them with a starting token and
ending token prefixed by a line comment.

After the comment the two character `>>` indicate that there is a starting token. Next come
the `id` of the snippet, this is wrapped in single quotes like this `id='snippet-name-goes-here'`
next are options, if you are not setting any it should be empty like this `options=''`
